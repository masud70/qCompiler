<h1 align="center">qCompiler: Simplifying Code Compilation</h1>

<p align="center"><b>qCompiler</b> is a versatile Node.js library designed for building online or offline code compiler applications. It enables seamless compilation for various languages on the server, providing outputs swiftly and efficiently.</p>

# Why qCompiler?
**qCompiler** offers a user-friendly solution for developers who want to integrate code compilation into their applications without the hassle of configuring compilers on the server. Whether you are building an educational platform, have coding challenges, or need a reliable code compilation service, **qCompiler** streamlines the process.

# Key Features
- **Language Support:** As an evolving project, qCompiler currently supports essential languages, including C, C++, Java, and Python. As the library expands, additional languages will be incorporated.

Supported Languages 
===================
qCompiler is currently in the initial development stage. As the library grows, so does the list here.

| Language | Support |
|-----------|:---------:|
|C |&#x2714;|
|C++ | &#x2714; |
|Java | &#x2714; |
|Python | &#x2714; |

# Workflow

1. **Receive Code and Input Data:** Get the program and input data from the client as requested.
   
2. **Compile the Program:** Utilize the qCompiler module to compile the program.

3. **Retrieve Output and Errors:** Obtain the output and errors in JSON and string formats.

4. **Respond to the Client:** Send the output back to the client.

# Setting Up Compilers

Before utilizing **qCompiler**, ensure that the necessary compilers for the target programming languages are set up on the server. Here's a brief guide to assist you:

## Installation and Testing the Environment

To compile programs in any programming language, you must have the relevant compiler installed on the server. Follow these steps to set up the compiler environment:

1. **GCC Compiler:** Install GCC compiler, which can compile programs from the command line. After installation, set environment variables to access GCC command lines from any directory.

### For Windows:
- Download [MinGw](http://www.mingw.org/) and install on your server machine.
- For a quick test, create a simple C/C++ file in any directory.
- Open a command prompt in that directory and run:
    ```bash
      path/to/minGW/g++ filename.c -o output.exe
    ```
- If this command runs smoothly and an `output.exe` file appears, your GCC compiler setup is good to go.

# Documentation

## Installation

```bash
  npm i qcompiler
```

## Usage

### **C/C++**
```javascript
const { compile } = require('qcompiler');
const systemCongig = {
 OS: "windows",
 cmd: "g++"
}
const language = "CPP";

const data = await compile(code, language, input, systemConfig);

console.log(data)
//  data.status = true/false
//  data.output = Output value
//  data.error  = Error message (if status == false)
```

### Language Parameter
To compile code in different languages a `language` parameter is required to pass. The value for this parameter for different language is as follows:
```javascript
// For C
const language = "C";

// For C++
const language = "CPP";

// For C
const language = "C";

// For Java
const language = "JAVA";

// For Python
const language = "PYTHON";
```
